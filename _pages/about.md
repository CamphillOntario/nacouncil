Anthroposophic curative education, youth guidance and social therapy offer education, learning support, training, work, and residential opportunities for children, youth and adults with disabilities.  Anthroposophic curative education, youth guidance and social therapy came into existence out of the spiritual insight by Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925).  

**"Curative Education"** refers to the work with children with special needs.  Kindergarten and school education in conjunction with specific therapies and often medical care provide an overall concept that aims to enhance child development.  The methods used are developed out of Anthroposophy; Waldorf education, therapeutic education, therapies such as therapeutic eurythmy and Anthroposophic medicine.  

**"Youth Guidance"** refers to the work with young adults with special needs.  Young adults with special needs need training before stepping fully into the life of adulthood.  Youth guidance centers offer vocational training and educaition to young adults with special needs.  Various social experience helps young adults grow as human beings, and become responsible adults in the world.

**"Social Therapy"** refers to work with adults with special needs.  Social therapy involves creating social situations that will allow people with special needs experience maximum independence and self-determination.  Suitable workplace and residential accommodation as well as cultural opportunities both outside and inside the centers help create life situations that encourage individual development in safe social settings.
