## Biodynamic Agriculture

Many NAC communities practice **biodynamic agriculture** and some offer training.  Biodynamic agriculture is a holistic and ecological approach to farming and gardening. It is based on the spiritual insights of Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925).  Biodynamic agriculture is practiced throughout the world, in thousand of gardens and farms.   Many farmers and gardeners strive to create a healthy and sustainable ecological system, as well as nutritious and flavorful food through practicing biodynamic agriculture.  Biodynamic preparations are made from fermented manure, herbs and minerals.   The preparations help restore the life forces of the agricultural land, and the earth.  Biodynamic farmers and gardeners strive to work with the influences of cosmic forces, as well. [(www.biodynamics.com)](http://www.biodynamics.com)

For more details please inquire directly with a local NAC community.
